# Automatic-Text-Summarization

This Text Summarization model is mainly based on Natural Language Libraries in python which helps in pre processing the text documents.

The algorithm is simple and straight-forward. It uses a score based system, where a score is assigned to each sentence by taking various factors into consideration. These effect of each of these factor is determined by various test runs of the algorithm to select a one-final weight of each factor in the final score.

Being a simple algorithm, this technique of summarization is extremely fast and very efficient. The size of the Summary Text ranges from 35% to 50%, which is really great in terms of larger texts.
